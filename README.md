The P2P File Transfer app enables you to easily send and receive files to other peers. Simply open the app on two different machines, press SENDER on one machine, and RECEIVER on the other one. Enter the token code from the sender to the receiver app and then press the JOIN button. Once the app is ready, you can send files between these two peers. Drag a file to the green circle area and wait for the file transfer. Press the orange cross icon anytime to cancel the file transfer. You can also reload the app to cancel the ongoing progress.

This web application is using WebSocket and WebRTC technologies to make the connection between two peers. For the WebSocket connection, currently, it uses https://replit.com/ - a cloud application hosting platform. It also uses the server.js code located in the server folder here to make the WSS server. You can change this server within the app UI by clicking on the settings button. Once the peer-to-peer connection is initiated, the app uses WebRTC for all the file transfer communications between peers. Therefore the WebSocket connection is no longer needed and automatically disconnects.

You can install this app as a PWA on your mobile device, moreover, it is available as a browser extension as well as a web application:
